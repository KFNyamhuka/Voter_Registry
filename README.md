# Voter Registration System
This is a basic voter registration system developed using Java Swing, Java JDK 13, Ant builder, Netbeans IDE 12.2, jCalender and MySQL database technologies
For easy testing we have added voter database in com.voter.resource, you can import the database and use the already provided username and database to login

# How the system works
-Firstly, open NetBeans IDE and run the main class to initialize the program then supply the login credentials.
-After logging in, two option are available. The first one is for registering a new voter, the second one is for populating the registered voters.
-Under 'Register', the following mandatory voter information is required for input for one to qualify to vote:

NAME
SURNAME
ID NUMBER
POLLING STATION
WARD
CONSTITUENCY
DISTRICT
DATE OF BIRTH
ADDRESS
GENDER

-After capturing of the above information is complete, the data is saved onto the database for storage.
-The voter's roll is accessible by clicking on the 'VOTERS' tab.
